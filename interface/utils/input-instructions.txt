* You have to input formulas in the 'regular' infix notation: for example,
    (P and not P) implies contra
* Use disambiguating parentheses where needed. They are not needed for
  conjunctions or disjunctions of more than 2 arguments.
* You can use the following options for the different tokens:
  - propositional parameters:
      a single uppercase or lowercase letter
  - conjunction:
      and, \land, \wedge, ^, &, &&, ∧
  - disjunction:
      or, \lor, \vee, v, |, ||, ∨
  - negation:
      not, \lnot, \neg, ~, !, ¬
  - implication:
      if, implies, \lif, \to, \rightarrow, ->, >, →
  - bi-implication:
      iff, \liff, \leftrightarrow, \equiv, <->, <=>, ↔
  - contradiction:
      contra, false, \lfalse, \bot, ⊥
  - parentheses:
      ( ) and [ ]
* You can put in the premises one by one at the prompt. When you are done with
  putting in the premises, type a ';' to continue to putting in the conclusion.

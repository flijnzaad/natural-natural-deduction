- Use outer parentheses around the sentence (but these could maybe also be
  added at the start if they are not present).
- For the connectives, use:
    \land
    \lor
    \lif
    \liff
    \lneg
    \lfalse
    - Use spaces between operators and other things.
    - For the propositional atoms only use capital letters.

    Maybe add support for other types of connectives as well if that's not too hard.
- Use parentheses around all unary and binary operands.

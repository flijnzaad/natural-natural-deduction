You have to input formulas in the 'regular' infix notation: for example,

    (P and not P) implies contra

Use disambiguating parentheses where needed.

You can use the following options for the different tokens:
    - propositional parameters:
        a single uppercase or lowercase letter
    - conjunction:
        and, \land, \wedge, ^, &, &&, ∧
    - disjunction:
        or, \lor, \vee, v, |, ||, ∨
    - negation:
        not, \lnot, \neg, ~, !, ¬
    - implication:
        if, implies, \lif, \to, \rightarrow, ->, →
    - bi-implication:
        iff, \liff, \leftrightarrow, \equiv, <->, <=>, ↔
    - contradiction:
        contra, false, \lfalse, \bot, ⊥
    - parentheses:
        ( ) and [ ]

You can put in the premises one by one at the prompt. When you are done with
putting in the premises, type a ';' to continue to putting in the conclusion.
